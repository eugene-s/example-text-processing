a popular idea in modern machine learning is to represent words by vectors
these vectors capture hidden information about a language like word analogies or semantic
it is also used to improve performance of text classifiers
in this tutorial we show how to build these word vectors with the fasttext tool
to download and install fasttext follow the first steps of the tutorial on text classification
